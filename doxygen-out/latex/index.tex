C++14, header-\/only library for multi-\/stream data synchronization.

\subsection*{What is this used for?}

This library is meant for generating groups of data from separate series. The core problems it is meant to address are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item How do we know what elements of data across multiple input streams relate to one other?
\item How do we know when this data is ready to be retrieved (\char`\"{}captured\char`\"{}) for further use?
\item How do we capture different types of data uniformly and with minimal overhead?
\end{DoxyItemize}

In addressing these problems, this library enables data-\/driven event execution using data collected from distinct streaming series.

\subsubsection*{Example use case}

At Fetch Robotics Inc., this library is used in tandem with R\+OS. R\+OS subscribers are used to feed data into {\ttfamily Flow} capture buffers with light message feeding callbacks. The callbacks transfer R\+OS messages into the appropriate {\ttfamily Flow} capture buffer. {\ttfamily Flow} entities are serviced separately to compute events from these messages. The resulting data frames from synchronization contain all messages needed to run a particular task. In this way, messages are also used as a pace-\/setting mechanism for core execution blocks.
